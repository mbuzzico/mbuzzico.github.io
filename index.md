My background and training are in **theoretical physics, statistical mechanics, high performance computing, big data,** and **physics of the atmosphere and meteorology**. I have always enjoyed approaching geophysical problems from both a theoretical and a numerical point of view. Since the beginning of my research career, I have worked on **Dynamical Systems** and **Turbulence** (both phenomenology and numerical simulations, with/without particles, in different setups, isotropic, anisotropic, wall-bounded, rotating/stratified), using **Pseudo-Spectral** codes, **Finite Difference** codes, Finite Difference** codes, **Lattice Boltzmann** and **Data-Driven Numerical Methods**, where I have been the group leader for the development of high performance codes to run on some of the largest HPC facilities in Europe. My activities range from the development of non-linear, out-of-equilibrium models for small-scale closure of high Reynolds flows to the **control Lagrangian turbulent problems**. From an applied point of view, I have worked on issues such as **optimal navigation** in complex environments. Today I am mainly active on the side of **Data Reconstruction** and **Physical Inference** problems, where I have worked on idealised/complex setups as high Reynolds rotating turbulent flows to reconstruct missing data from partial measurements. I have also recently initiated a new major research area on **Geophysical Data Analysis** with the aim of disentangling the role of multiscale physical mechanisms at play in the ocean, which has recently resulted in the publication of the kinetic global energy spectrum of the general ocean circulation.

Within the [Department of Physics in Tor Vergata](https://www.fisica.uniroma2.it/) I am part of the ERC Advanced Grant project Smart-TURB, PI: [Prof. Luca Biferale](https://biferale.web.roma2.infn.it/). 

I am involved in several national and international collaborations, the main one being with [Prof. Hussein](http://www.complexflowgroup.com/) Aluie from the [University of Rochester (NY, USA)](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/me/index.html) for the development of multi-scale analysis methods for complex systems of geophysical interest, as the global Ocean circulation.
