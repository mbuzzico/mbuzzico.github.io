Hello! I am a **theoretical physicist** at the [University of Rome Tor Vergata](https://www.fisica.uniroma2.it/) specialising in **statistical mechanics, high performance computing, big data,** and **physics of the atmosphere and meteorology**. In general, I enjoy approaching complex multi-scale geophysical problems from both a theoretical and a numerical point of view.

Since the beginning of my research career I have worked on **Dynamical Systems** and **Turbulence** (both phenomenology and numerical simulations, with/without particles, in different setups, isotropic, anisotropic, wall-bounded, rotating/stratified), using **Pseudo-Spectral** codes, **Finite Difference** codes, **Lattice Boltzmann** codes and **Data-Driven Numerical Methods**, where I was the group leader for the development of high performance codes to run on some of the largest HPC facilities in Europe. My activities range from the development of non-linear, out-of-equilibrium models for small-scale closure of high Reynolds flows to **control Lagrangian turbulent problems**. From an applied point of view, I have worked on topics such as **optimal navigation** in complex environments. Today I am mainly active on the side of **data reconstruction** and **physical inference** problems, where I have worked on idealised/complex setups such as high Reynolds rotating turbulent flows to reconstruct missing data from partial measurements. I have also recently initiated a new major research area on **geophysical data analysis**, with the aim of disentangling the role of multiscale physical mechanisms at play in the ocean, which has recently led to the publication of the kinetic global energy spectrum of the general ocean circulation.

Within the [Department of Physics in Tor Vergata](https://www.fisica.uniroma2.it/) I am part of the ERC Advanced Grant project Smart-TURB, PI: [Prof. Luca Biferale](https://biferale.web.roma2.infn.it/). 

I am involved in several national and international collaborations, the main one being with [Prof. Hussein Aluie](http://www.complexflowgroup.com/) from the [University of Rochester (NY, USA)](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/me/index.html) for the development of multi-scale analysis methods for complex systems of geophysical interest, as the global Ocean circulation.
