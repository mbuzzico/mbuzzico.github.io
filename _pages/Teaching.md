During my graduate studies at Princeton, I participated in the [Teaching Transcript Program](https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/graduate-students/teaching-transcript) through the [McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning](https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/).
The program consisted of pedagogy workshops aimed at developing strategies for effective teaching and mentoring, an assistant instructor appointment, and class observation with feedback. 
Through the program I learned how to be sensitive towards issues facing modern students and refined my teaching methods. 

I was an instructor assistant for a combined undergraduate/graduate course titled **Introduction to Ocean Physics for Climate** (GEO/MAE 425), taught by Gabe Vecchi and Sonya Legg. 
My roles included grading homework assignments and exams, hosting office hours each week, teaching several lectures, and helping oversee the laboratory component of the course. I have also given guest lectures in geophysical fluid dynamics and an introductory climate science class at NYU.
