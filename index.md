Michele Buzzicotti is a theoretical physicist active in the field of Statistical Mechanics and Complex Systems. His main research activity is in the study of turbulent flows using direct numerical simulations and Artificial Intelligence tools. Working from both Eulerian and Lagrangian points of view, he is interested in the development of new paradigms for data analysis as well as of non-linear, out of equilibrium models, such as Large-Eddy-Simulation closures for the small-scale dynamics of high Reynolds flows.

Within the [Department of Physics in Tor Vergata](https://www.fisica.uniroma2.it/) is part of the ERC Advanced Grant project ["Smart-TURB"](https://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it/init/routes/#/logging/welcome), PI: Prof. Luca Biferale. At the same time, he is involved in other collaborations within the Department, the main ones are the collaborations with Prof. Mauro Sbragaglia for Lattice Boltzmann simulations and with Prof. Nazario Tantalo to apply AI techniques for the solution of inverse problems of high energy physics. 

Dr. Buzzicotti has a visiting scholar position at the [University of Rochester (NY, USA)](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/me/index.html) for collaboration with Prof. Hussein Aluie on the analysis of geophysical data.
